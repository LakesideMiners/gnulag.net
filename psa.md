# I want to clear the air around what's been happening in the channel lately.

People have quit because apparently shutting down the likes of **theluke** is "infringing on free speech". This has been said a few times over the last 3 years, but evidently not enough - the channel's edgy but that doesn't give you the right to attack someone for their sexual orientation, trans status, or mental illness. There is a difference between casual banter between friends, and something said with the intent to hurt.

This is a bit vague for sure, and people (including me) have had trouble figuring out where to draw the line. It moves around as people join and leave, and the overall tone / culture changes. We banned transphobic slurs as we gained trans members, for example, and most of you have probably had a mod reach out to you about a certain member's condition to make sure they're not bullied over it.

**Luke** purposefully picked fights, and abused lgbt members for months. He also repeatedly made fun of someone's mental condition to the point of triggering them. One trans member had an actual breakdown and quit because of them. If you can't tell the difference between that and old friends calling each other names, then please leave. **#gnulag** is not for you.

If you can empathize with the fact that a large number of people in here have had a traumatic past, that from it follows bias and low trigger points, and that being kind is more important than being right, then please stay. Trans members might take extra offense at a transphobic joke, for example, and someone with schizophrenia might blow up when people don't believe them.
There's also enough people in here that there's going to be a lot of opinions - wrong ones - flying around. That's human, everyone's wrong all the time. Say your piece, then bow out. Disagree, but don't make it a personal crusade to change the other person's beliefs. You might not grok where they're coming from, and might end up attacking a coping mechanism.

If you don't see what's wrong with that, again, please leave. This is not the place for you. For the rest of us, let's try to make it so we're making each other less broken over time, instead of the other way around. Be excellent to each other, that's the sigma grindset.
