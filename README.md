# GNU/Lag

Welcome to browndawg's highbrown society for programmers and sysadmins.

## Rules

GNU/Lag doesn't have many rules you'd have to explicitly state. Don't be a dick, and you should be fine.

* No CP (we'll report you to every three letter agency in existence).
* `NSFW` content need not be marked. Please mark gore and such as `NSFL`.
* No lurking.
* No non-creative spam.
* Don't post logs anywhere.
* Don't sneeze whilst getting fingered.
* No piracy or shady shit (`.torrent` or `.onion`). Network rules, don't look at us. You can talk about these things, but no links.

While the channel was mostly founded by members of another `Linux` channel, `#gnulag` is a general programming + sysadmin channel. You'll find a wide range of topics being discussed, including, but not limited to:

* Anything other than Linux.
* Communism, Capitalism, Anarcho-syndicorporalicapitalisticimperialism within closed communal tribes.
* Music / Books / Movies / Anime / TV.
* Drugs.
* Computer Science and Programming.
* Zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms.
* Poor career decisions (ask `whiteph`, `cheers` and `belzurix`).
* Bad Dragons (actually, dildos of all shapes and sizes).
* Definitions of controversial words.
* Religion, and the occult.
* Life size Lennart Poettering cutouts with a hole where the mouth is supposed to be.
* LGBQIA stuff, porn, and sexuality in general.
* The existential threat of frontend web development.
* The UNIX philosophy and ~~how modern development is taking a giant shit on it~~ how good Lennart looks in plaid.
* Definitely not talking about inline skating.

## FAQ

### Who do I ask for help?

* `browndawg` | `Richard-Stalin`
* `crystalmett`
* `iownall555`
* `Zowlyfon` | `Z`
* `A_Dragon` | `Roy_Mustang`
* `AWindowsKrill` | `Volkor`
* `MrNeon`
* `TinyTimmyTokyo` for Gantoo Lunix help or tips.
* `Lucifer` | `The Antichrist` | `The Prince of Lies`
* `Anyone on the Suckless mailing list`

In that order.

### How do I register my nickname?

https://snoonet.org/anope#NickServ.

### How do I use Snoonet?

* [Snoonet Help](https://snoonet.org/help)
* [Registering Your Nickname](https://snoonet.org/anope#NickServ.)

### How do I stay permanently connected to the channel?

* `/mode +j #gnulag`, or google on how to set up `autojoin` in your IRC client.
* Get a [Snoonet BNC](https://snoonet.org/bnc) account (if you don't already have one), or set up a [Quassel Core](https://quassel-irc.org/) somewhere.
* Alternatively, ping `crystalmett` or `browndawg` for an account on their server.

### Can I ask for programming / unix help?

Yes. We're not an official help channel, but regulars will often help you out with technical issues if they have the time (and you're not a dick). If you're going to ask a question, make sure to include what you're doing and what you've tried so far.

### How do I share images / files / text on IRC?

You'll have to host it somewhere, and share a public link. [Imgur](https://imgur.com) is a popular choice, but a lot of us use [Teknik](https://teknik.io), and [TransferSH](https://transfer.sh).

For code or any arbitrary text really [github gist](https://gist.github.com/) is a good choice.

There are scripts and tools that can automate this for you. Ask on the channel.

### Is this just #linuxmasterrace with porn?

No. Its #lmr with porn and commies, minus the [m]atrix lurkers. **Not affiliated with the subreddit / channel.**.

## Bots & Games

Here's [the entire list of gonzobot commands](https://snoonet.org/gonzobot).

We are running a n2n supernode for p2p connections. Refer to [here](https://github.com/ntop/n2n) for instruction on how to install the client (edge node), then connect with `sudo edge -d n2n0 -c gnulag -k <insert secret password here> -l cocaine.farm:7654 -a 10.255.88.<your ip number thingy here>`

* [cocaine.farm](https://cocaine.farm) gameservers (game - port)
    * (minecraft - `25565`) currently shut down. Can be resurrected
    * xonotic - `26000`

### Xonotic
To connect to the xonotic server get [xonotic](http://xonotic.org/), start it, open the console with `~` and type `connect cocaine.farm:26000`. You will need to reconnect on map change
