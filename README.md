# GNU/Lag

Welcome to browndawg's highbrown society. Programmers + Sysadmins welcome.

## Rules

GNU/Lag doesn't have many rules you'd have to explicitly state. Don't be a dick, and you should be fine.

* No CP (we'll report you to every three letter agency in existence).
* `NSFW` content need not be marked. Please mark gore and such as `NSFL`.
* No lurking.
* No non-creative spam.
* Don't post logs publicly.
* Don't sneeze whilst getting fingered.
* No bridges. Don't use them. Don't request we use them. No Matrix users (thank {insert your particular $DEITY here}).
* No piracy or shady shit (`.torrent` or `.onion`). Network rules, don't look at us. You can talk about these things, but no links.

## Topics

While the channel was mostly founded by members of another `Linux` channel, `#gnulag` is a general programming + sysadmin channel. You'll find a wide range of topics being discussed, including, but not limited to:

* Anything other than Linux.
* Communism, Capitalism, Anarcho-syndicorporalicapitalisticimperialism within closed communal tribes.
* Music / Books / Movies / Anime / TV.
* Drugs.
* Computer Science and Programming.
* Zygohistomorphic prepromorphisms.
* Poor career decisions (ask `whiteph` and `cheers`).
* Bad Dragons (actually, dildos of all shapes and sizes).
* Definitions of controversial words.
* Regilion, and the occult.
* Life size Lennart Poettering cutouts with a hole where the mouth is supposed to be.
* LGBQIA stuff, porn, and sexuality in general.
* The existential threat of frontend web development.
* The UNIX philosophy and ~~how modern development is taking a giant shit on it~~ how good Lennart looks in plaid.
* Definitely not talking about inline skating.

* `Zowlyfon` | `Z`
* `A_Dragon` | `Roy_Mustang`
* `AWindowsKrill` | `Volkor`

In that order.

### How do I register my nickname?

https://snoonet.org/anope#NickServ.

### How do I use Snoonet?

* [Snoonet Help](https://snoonet.org/help)
* [Registering Your Nickname](https://snoonet.org/anope#NickServ.)

### How do I stay permanently connected to the channel?

* `/mode +j #gnulag`, or google on how to set up `autojoin` in your IRC client.
* Get a [Snoonet BNC](https://snoonet.org/bnc) account (if you don't already have one), or set up a [Quassel Core](https://quassel-irc.org/) somewhere (we miss you `justJanne` :( ).
* Alternatively, `ping vim.ninja`. If you're close enough to the server, ping `browndawg` for an account on his bouncer.

### Can I ask for programming / unix help?

Yes. We're not an official help channel, but regulars will often help you out with technical issues if they have the time (and you're not a dick). If you're going to ask a question, make sure to include what you're doing and what you've tried so far.

### How do I share images / files / text on IRC?

You'll have to host it somewhere, and share a public link. [Imgur](https://imgur.com) is a popular choice, but a lot of us use [Teknik](https://teknik.io), [TransferSH](https://transfer.sh), or [ptpb](https://ptpb.pw).

For code or any arbitrary text really [github gist](https://gist.github.com/) is a good choice.

There are scripts and tools that can automate this for you. Ask on the channel.

### Is this just #linuxmasterrace with porn?

No. Its #lmr with porn and commies, minus the [m]atrix lurkers. **Not affiliated with the subreddit / channel.**.
