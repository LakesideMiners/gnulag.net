# Help TinyTimmyTokyo escape their personal situation - a plea for help

## Background

### Who is TinyTimmyTokyo?
TinyTimmyTokyo (aka ShospleColupis, IAmGodAMA, NormalF*ckingIsSoOverrated, _et al._) is one of the founding members of #gnulag, and
was even a regular on its predecessor, the now defunct #linux_master_bait .

### Why does TinyTimmyTokyo need help?

A multitude of reasons:
* They're gay and they live deep in the south of Alabama
* Their parents have gone off the deep end of "conservatism" and are now arguably batshit insane
* Both of the above have completely f*cked up their mental and emotional well-being

## How you can help

First, before you do any of the below, _please_ reach out to them via PM on Snoonet, our host network (their current
nick is "ShospleColupis").

### A place to stay for a bit

If either you can take them in yourselves, or you know someone else that you would trust to, please let them know.
They probably need to stay for about a month, so they can get a job, line up an apartment, etc.

### Cash

They normally hate to ask for money, but their bank account is stretched a bit thin (they probably have enough for a
Greyhound/plane ticket and a couple of weeks of groceries).

### Transportation

Due to financial constraints (they haven't been able to afford driver's insurance), they haven't learnt to drive. 
Thus, they'll likely need a ride to work (if continued use of public transportation doesn't remain feasible).

## Why should I help

Some reasons:
* Mental health is not something to f*ck with.
* It's a decent thing to do.
* If the situation was flipped they'd help _you_ in a heartbeat.
